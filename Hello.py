        The Pokemon Tournament Training Club has began it's 2024 Season Training! This upcoming season is going to be very different however. We have been hard at work creating the ultimate application that helps create winning decks. This year we are unveiling the **Pokemon Card-based Helper for Assessing Match Performance System**! We like to call it **Pokemon CHAMPS** around the office though.

        This revolutionary application will take the input of user cards and outputs the potential success rating for the user. The application will also output potential add-on's to your deck to add more flavor and achieve tournament dominance!
